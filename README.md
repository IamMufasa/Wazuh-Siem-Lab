# Hands-on Wazuh SIEM Lab: Monitoring, Detection, and Response

> **Project Status:** Completed ✅  
> **Project Type:** Home Lab | Cybersecurity SIEM | Threat Detection & Response

## 📝 Project Overview
In this lab project, I deployed and configured a full Wazuh SIEM environment to enhance my practical skills in Security Monitoring, Log Analysis, Incident Response, and Threat Hunting. 

The goal was to simulate an enterprise environment, integrate threat intelligence tools, and build a proactive defense system capable of detecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threats.
